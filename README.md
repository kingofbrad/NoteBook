# What is this application

This is a simple notebook that I created to learn Javascript and some frameworks/libraries such as React, Chakra-UI

## Available Scripts

this project uses NPM as the main manager.

Use `npm start` to start the project within the termial of choice

`npm build` will build the production version of the application but that won't really needed for this as this project is just something
I did to advance my knowlodge within Javascript, React and Chakra-UI

## Why I choose the frameworks/libraries?

I chose the use react as that's the current library i am currently studying and using in my main portfolio so to improve my understading, I dedcided to create most of my project within react.

As for Chakra-Ui. In my opinion Chakra-UI is one of the best looking libraries to date and its easy to learn and understand. The documentation is very usuful and they provide snippets of code to help the users with their learning curve.
